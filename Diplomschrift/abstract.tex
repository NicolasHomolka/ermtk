\noindent
The goal of the ERMTK-ERD project was to implement a program that generates automatically, with an XML-File as input, an Entity-Relationship Diagram.
This was implemented with four different output formats. To combine these four variations, this proprietory Entity-Relationship-Modeling-Toolkit has been written. Furthermore, the user should be able to adjust the appearence of the graph with specific commandline parameters. 
The four different base programms are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Graphml
	\item LibreOffice Draw
	\item PIC-Code
	\item Graphviz
\end{itemize}
